/**
 * Golden Path Seed
 *
 * Creates a clean, realistic dataset for golden path demos:
 *   1. Greenfield Academy (school) — 2 lesson plans, 2 classes, 8 students
 *   2. Apex Consulting (corporate) — 1 training plan, 1 team, 6 employees
 *   3. Companion (community) — 2 programmes, 1 community, 6 members
 *   4. Bright Path Training (training) — 12 courses, 1 cohort, 8 participants
 *   5. Momentum Coaching (coaching) — 2 coaching plans, 1 group, 6 clients
 *   6. St. Aidan's Community Health (healthcare) — 2 care plans, 1 team, 6 patients
 *
 * ENRICHMENT: ~50% of learners get "lived data" (calls, scores, memories,
 * personality profiles, goals, targets, onboarding). The rest are "new"
 * (enrolled but not yet called). This creates realistic empty vs populated states.
 *
 * Each institution gets an EDUCATOR login (hff2026) so terminology resolves correctly.
 * Additional RBAC demo users: admin@hff.com (ADMIN), viewer@hff.com (VIEWER).
 * All entities tagged with "golden-" externalId prefix for idempotent cleanup.
 *
 * Non-PROD only — refuses to run when NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=LIVE.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SEED_PROFILE=golden npx tsx prisma/seed-full.ts --reset
 *   npx tsx prisma/seed-golden.ts          # standalone

    `AI: Good morning, {{name}}! Today we're going to work on reading comprehension. I've got a really interesting passage about the rainforest. Ready?\nUser: Yeah, I like animals so that sounds good.\nAI: Perfect! Here's the first paragraph. Read it carefully and tell me what the main idea is.\nUser: It's about how animals in the rainforest depend on each other?\nAI: Exactly right! That's called an ecosystem. Can you find a specific example from the text?\nUser: The bit about the toucan eating berries and then spreading the seeds?\nAI: Brilliant! That's a great example of how animals help plants reproduce. What word in the text describes this relationship?\nUser: Symbiotic?\nAI: Well done! You're really getting the hang of finding key vocabulary in context.`,
    `AI: Hi {{name}}! Let's practise some maths today. We're going to work on fractions. What do you already know about adding fractions?\nUser: You need the same bottom number... the denominator?\nAI: That's right! When the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators. What about when they're different?\nUser: I think you have to make them the same first? Like find a common number?\nAI: Spot on! Let's try this: what's 1/3 + 1/4?\nUser: Um... 12 is a common number for both. So... 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12?\nAI: That's perfect! You found the lowest common denominator and converted both fractions correctly. How are you feeling about that?\nUser: Actually quite good! It makes more sense when you explain it step by step.`,
    `AI: Welcome back, {{name}}! Today we're going to do some creative writing. I'd like you to write the opening paragraph of a story set in space. What ideas come to mind?\nUser: Maybe something about an astronaut who finds a strange signal?\nAI: Ooh, I love that idea! Think about your senses — what would the astronaut see, hear, and feel? That'll make your opening really vivid.\nUser: The lights on the dashboard are flickering and there's a low humming sound that wasn't there before?\nAI: That's fantastic sensory detail! Now turn that into a sentence. Remember, strong openings often start with action.\nUser: "Captain Reyes gripped the armrest as the dashboard lights flickered red, and a low hum filled the cockpit."\nAI: What a brilliant opening sentence! You've created tension immediately. The reader wants to know what happens next.`,
  ],
  corporate: [
    `AI: Good morning, {{name}}. Last session we talked about delegation. How has it been going this week?\nUser: I tried delegating the quarterly report to Sarah, but I ended up checking on it three times.\nAI: That's actually progress — you delegated it. The checking is natural at first. What were you worried about?\nUser: Honestly? That it wouldn't be up to my standard.\nAI: And what happened when you saw Sarah's work?\nUser: It was different from how I'd do it, but actually caught some things I might have missed.\nAI: That's a powerful insight. Different doesn't mean worse. What would you do differently next time?\nUser: Maybe set clearer expectations upfront instead of hovering.\nAI: Excellent. Clear expectations plus trust — that's the delegation sweet spot. Let's practise that framework.`,
    `AI: {{name}}, today let's focus on giving feedback to your team. Tell me about a recent situation where you needed to give difficult feedback.\nUser: One of my direct reports keeps missing deadlines. I've been avoiding the conversation.\nAI: What's holding you back from having it?\nUser: I don't want to demotivate them. They're talented but disorganised.\nAI: That concern shows good emotional intelligence. Let's use the SBI framework — Situation, Behaviour, Impact. Can you describe the situation?\nUser: Last Tuesday, the client deck was due and it arrived two hours late.\nAI: Good. Now the behaviour — what specifically did they do or not do?\nUser: They didn't flag that they were running behind. I only found out when the client asked.\nAI: And the impact?\nUser: We looked unprepared and I had to apologise to the client.\nAI: Perfect. Now you have a clear, non-judgmental framework. Would you like to role-play the conversation?`,
    `AI: Welcome back, {{name}}. Today's topic is stakeholder management. Who are your key stakeholders right now?\nUser: My boss, the product team, and the VP of Sales who keeps asking for features.\nAI: Let's map their priorities. What does each one care about most?\nUser: My boss wants delivery on time. Product wants quality. Sales wants everything yesterday.\nAI: Classic tension triangle. When these priorities conflict, how do you decide?\nUser: Usually whoever shouts loudest gets attention. I know that's not great.\nAI: At least you're honest about it! A stakeholder matrix can help — influence vs. interest. Where would you place the VP of Sales?\nUser: High influence, high interest. So I need to manage them closely.\nAI: Exactly. And what's one thing you could do this week to build that relationship proactively?`,
  ],
  community: [
    `AI: Hey {{name}}, welcome back. How have things been since we last spoke?\nUser: Up and down, honestly. Work's been really stressful.\nAI: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been the hardest part?\nUser: Just feeling like I can never switch off. Even at home I'm thinking about work.\nAI: That boundary between work and home is one of the hardest things to manage. What does "switching off" look like for you ideally?\nUser: Being able to sit with my family without checking emails.\nAI: That's a really clear picture. Have you tried any strategies for that?\nUser: I tried leaving my phone in another room but kept going to get it.\nAI: The pull is strong! What if we set a smaller goal first — like 30 minutes phone-free after dinner?\nUser: That actually sounds doable.`,
    `AI: Hi {{name}}! Today we're going to talk about budgeting — one of the most practical life skills there is. How do you currently manage your money?\nUser: Not very well, to be honest. I kind of just spend until it runs out.\nAI: No judgement at all — that's more common than you'd think. Do you know roughly how much you spend each month?\nUser: Maybe £1,500? I'm not sure.\nAI: Let's find out. The first step is tracking for just one week. Write down every single thing you spend. Sound manageable?\nUser: Yeah, I can do a week.\nAI: Great. When you have that data, we can spot patterns together. Most people are surprised by what they find.\nUser: I bet it's takeaways for me.\nAI: Ha! Well, let's find out. No assumptions — just data. We'll review it next time.`,
    `AI: {{name}}, last time you mentioned wanting to feel more confident in social situations. How has that been?\nUser: I went to that community event like we discussed. It was terrifying.\nAI: But you went! That takes courage. What happened?\nUser: I stood by the drinks table for about ten minutes. Then someone came and talked to me about the music.\nAI: And how was that conversation?\nUser: Actually okay. We talked for about twenty minutes about bands we like.\nAI: That's wonderful. You didn't have to force it — it happened naturally. What did you learn from that?\nUser: Maybe I don't need to approach people. I just need to be somewhere approachable.\nAI: That's a really wise observation. Being present and open is its own kind of confidence.`,
  ],
  training: [
    `AI: Welcome, {{name}}! Today's session is on presentation skills. Have you given many presentations at work?\nUser: A few, but I always get really nervous and rush through my slides.\nAI: Nerves are completely normal — even experienced presenters get them. Let's work on pacing first. What happens when you rush?\nUser: I forget things and the audience looks confused.\nAI: Right. Here's a technique: the power pause. After each key point, stop for three seconds. It feels like forever, but the audience processes the information.\nUser: Three seconds? That sounds like a long time.\nAI: It does, doesn't it? Let's practise. Tell me your opening line for your next presentation.\nUser: "Today I'm going to walk you through our Q1 results and what they mean for our strategy."\nAI: Good content. Now say it again, and pause for three seconds after "Q1 results".\nUser: "Today I'm going to walk you through our Q1 results... and what they mean for our strategy."\nAI: Did you feel the difference? That pause added weight to what came next.`,
    `AI: {{name}}, today we're covering conflict resolution. Think of a recent workplace disagreement you observed or were part of.\nUser: Two of my colleagues disagreed about how to handle a client complaint. It got quite heated.\nAI: What was the core issue underneath the argument?\nUser: I think one wanted to keep the client happy at all costs, and the other wanted to stick to policy.\nAI: Classic values conflict — flexibility vs. consistency. Both are valid. When you see that, what could you do as a mediator?\nUser: Ask each person to explain their reasoning?\nAI: That's a great start. The key is to separate the person from the position. Make them feel heard before problem-solving. What question could you ask?\nUser: "Help me understand why this approach matters to you?"\nAI: Perfect. That question invites explanation without judgement. You'd be a natural mediator.`,
    `AI: Hi {{name}}! Ready for today's session on time management?\nUser: Definitely. I feel like I'm always busy but never actually getting the important things done.\nAI: That's the urgency trap — urgent tasks crowd out important ones. Do you know the Eisenhower Matrix?\nUser: The four-quadrant thing? Urgent vs. important?\nAI: That's the one. Let's apply it. What's on your to-do list today?\nUser: Reply to emails, prepare the board report, fix a bug in the dashboard, and have a 1:1 with my junior.\nAI: Great list. Which of those is important but not urgent?\nUser: The board report. It's due Friday but I keep putting it off.\nAI: Classic quadrant 2. And what's urgent but not important?\nUser: Probably the emails. They feel urgent but most can wait.\nAI: So if you blocked two hours this morning for the board report — no emails — how would that change your day?\nUser: I'd actually feel like I accomplished something meaningful.`,
  ],
  coaching: [
    `AI: {{name}}, welcome back. Last time we set your 90-day goal around the new role. How has the first week been?\nUser: Harder than I expected. The stakeholder dynamics are more political than my last company.\nAI: That's a really common pattern in senior transitions. Tell me more — what's the specific dynamic catching you off guard?\nUser: My peer in Product seems to want to own the roadmap entirely. I feel like I'm being sidelined before I've even started.\nAI: And what do you want from this situation ideally?\nUser: Collaborative ownership. I don't want the territory — I want the outcomes.\nAI: That's a powerful reframe. What would it look like to make your first move from that position?\nUser: Invite her to co-present the Q2 strategy rather than competing for it.\nAI: I love that. What's the earliest you could make that happen?\nUser: I could suggest it at tomorrow's planning meeting.`,
    `AI: {{name}}, today I want to explore something deeper. You mentioned feeling stuck — like you're successful on paper but unfulfilled. What does that look like day to day?\nUser: I get through my work, hit my targets, but at the end of the day I feel... empty?\nAI: When was the last time you felt genuinely energised by your work?\nUser: Honestly? About three years ago, when I was leading that community project.\nAI: What was different about it?\nUser: I was building something that mattered. It wasn't just about the numbers.\nAI: So purpose and impact are core drivers for you. That's important self-knowledge. How does your current role connect to those values?\nUser: It doesn't, really. It's all optimisation and cost-cutting.\nAI: If you could redesign your role to include more of what energises you — even 20% — what would that look like?\nUser: Maybe I could lead our new sustainability initiative. Nobody's picked it up yet.`,
    `AI: Good to see you, {{name}}. What would make today's session most useful?\nUser: I need to work on my confidence. I've been offered a board presentation slot and I'm terrified.\nAI: Terrified how? What's the worst-case scenario in your mind?\nUser: That they'll ask a question I can't answer and I'll look incompetent.\nAI: Has that happened before — being asked something you couldn't answer?\nUser: Sure, plenty of times.\nAI: And what happened? Were you fired? Laughed at?\nUser: No... I usually said I'd follow up and then sent the answer later.\nAI: So your track record is 100% recovery. That's not incompetence — that's professionalism. What would it feel like to trust that pattern?\nUser: I guess... I'd be less worried about being perfect and more focused on being useful.\nAI: "Less perfect, more useful." Can we make that your mantra for the presentation?`,

  healthcare: [
    `AI: Hello {{name}}, how are you feeling today? Let's check in on how things have been going with your blood pressure management.\nUser: Not great, to be honest. I keep forgetting to take my tablets in the morning.\nAI: That's really common — you're not alone in that. What's your morning routine like?\nUser: I get up, make tea, read the news, then rush out to work.\nAI: What if we linked the tablet to something you already do? Like right next to the kettle?\nUser: I never thought of that. Put the tablets by the tea bags?\nAI: Exactly — it's called habit stacking. You attach the new habit to one you already have. Would you be willing to try that this week?\nUser: Yeah, that sounds simple enough.\nAI: Perfect. And no pressure if you forget a day — just pick it up again. How has the low-salt diet been going?`,
    `AI: {{name}}, welcome back. Today I'd like to talk about physical activity. Last time you mentioned wanting to be more active. How has that been?\nUser: I've been walking the dog more, but nothing beyond that.\nAI: Walking the dog counts! How far do you usually go?\nUser: About twenty minutes around the park.\nAI: That's great — the NHS recommends 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. Twenty minutes five times a week gets you to 100. You're two-thirds of the way there already.\nUser: Really? I thought it had to be the gym or running.\nAI: Not at all. Brisk walking is one of the best things you can do. Would you be open to making one of those walks a little longer — say thirty minutes?\nUser: I could do that on weekends when I'm not rushing.\nAI: Perfect plan. And how's your energy been? Sometimes people notice they sleep better once they're more active.`,
    `AI: Hi {{name}}. How has your week been with the diabetes management plan we discussed?\nUser: Mixed. I've been good with checking my blood sugar but the diet part is hard.\nAI: Let's focus on what's going well first — regular monitoring is a huge achievement. What made that easier?\nUser: The alarm on my phone. I just do it when it goes off.\nAI: Brilliant. Now, what's the hardest part of the dietary changes?\nUser: Evenings. After dinner I always want something sweet.\nAI: That craving is really normal, especially while your body adjusts. What sweet things do you currently reach for?\nUser: Biscuits, mostly. Or chocolate.\nAI: What if we found a swap rather than cutting it out entirely? Some people find berries with a spoon of yoghurt hits the spot.\nUser: I do like raspberries actually.\nAI: That's a great option — low sugar, high fibre. Would you be willing to try raspberries and yoghurt for three evenings this week and see how it feels?`,
