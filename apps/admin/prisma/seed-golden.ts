/**
 * Golden Path Seed — Demo Edition
 *
 * Creates a clean, focused demo dataset:
 *   1 institution: Abacus Academy (school) — 1 course, 1 class, 4 students
 *   1 educator login: sarah@abacus.academy (hff2026)
 *   1 fully seeded course: Year 5 Maths with teaching points, curriculum, and lesson plan
 *
 * ENRICHMENT: ~50% of learners get "lived data" (calls, scores, memories,
 * personality profiles, goals, targets, onboarding). The rest are "new"
 * (enrolled but not yet called). This creates realistic empty vs populated states.
 *
 * All entities tagged with "golden-" externalId prefix for idempotent cleanup.
 * Non-PROD only — refuses to run when NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=LIVE.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SEED_PROFILE=golden npx tsx prisma/seed-full.ts --reset
 *   npx tsx prisma/seed-golden.ts          # standalone

    `AI: Good morning, {{name}}! Today we're going to work on reading comprehension. I've got a really interesting passage about the rainforest. Ready?\nUser: Yeah, I like animals so that sounds good.\nAI: Perfect! Here's the first paragraph. Read it carefully and tell me what the main idea is.\nUser: It's about how animals in the rainforest depend on each other?\nAI: Exactly right! That's called an ecosystem. Can you find a specific example from the text?\nUser: The bit about the toucan eating berries and then spreading the seeds?\nAI: Brilliant! That's a great example of how animals help plants reproduce. What word in the text describes this relationship?\nUser: Symbiotic?\nAI: Well done! You're really getting the hang of finding key vocabulary in context.`,
    `AI: Hi {{name}}! Let's practise some maths today. We're going to work on fractions. What do you already know about adding fractions?\nUser: You need the same bottom number... the denominator?\nAI: That's right! When the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators. What about when they're different?\nUser: I think you have to make them the same first? Like find a common number?\nAI: Spot on! Let's try this: what's 1/3 + 1/4?\nUser: Um... 12 is a common number for both. So... 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12?\nAI: That's perfect! You found the lowest common denominator and converted both fractions correctly. How are you feeling about that?\nUser: Actually quite good! It makes more sense when you explain it step by step.`,
    `AI: Welcome back, {{name}}! Today we're going to do some creative writing. I'd like you to write the opening paragraph of a story set in space. What ideas come to mind?\nUser: Maybe something about an astronaut who finds a strange signal?\nAI: Ooh, I love that idea! Think about your senses — what would the astronaut see, hear, and feel? That'll make your opening really vivid.\nUser: The lights on the dashboard are flickering and there's a low humming sound that wasn't there before?\nAI: That's fantastic sensory detail! Now turn that into a sentence. Remember, strong openings often start with action.\nUser: "Captain Reyes gripped the armrest as the dashboard lights flickered red, and a low hum filled the cockpit."\nAI: What a brilliant opening sentence! You've created tension immediately. The reader wants to know what happens next.`,
