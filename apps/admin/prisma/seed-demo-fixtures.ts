 * Seed Demo Fixtures
 *
 * Creates predictable, well-populated entities for demo screenshot capture.
 * Idempotent — safe to run repeatedly (uses upsert patterns).

 * Entities created:
 *   - Domain: "Quantum Mechanics Tutor" (slug: qm-tutor)
 *   - Caller: "Paul" (externalId: demo-paul) with personality data
 *   - 5 calls with realistic transcripts
 *   - 6 caller memories
 *   - 1 memory summary
 *   - 1 published playbook with spec items
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   - Database migrated (npx prisma db push / migrate)

    transcript: `AI: Welcome back, Paul! Last time we were discussing quantum superposition. How did your reading go?\nUser: Pretty well actually. I think I understand the basic idea — a particle exists in multiple states until measured.\nAI: Exactly right! That's the core principle. Can you think of an everyday analogy that captures this idea?\nUser: Maybe like a coin spinning in the air? Before it lands, it's both heads and tails.\nAI: That's a great analogy! Now, how does this relate to Schrödinger's cat thought experiment?\nUser: The cat is both alive and dead until you open the box, right? It's in a superposition of states.\nAI: Perfect understanding. Let's explore what happens when we actually make a measurement...`,
  },
  {
    source: "demo-fixture",
    transcript: `AI: Hi Paul! Today let's tackle wave-particle duality. Ready?\nUser: Yeah, this is the one that confuses me the most.\nAI: That's totally normal — it confused physicists too! Let's start simple. What do you know about how light behaves?\nUser: Well, sometimes it acts like a wave, like in diffraction. And sometimes like particles, like in the photoelectric effect.\nAI: Excellent recall! Now here's the key question: is light a wave or a particle?\nUser: Both? Neither? It depends on how you observe it?\nAI: You're getting right to the heart of it. The nature of light depends on the experimental setup. This is wave-particle duality.`,
  },
  {
    source: "demo-fixture",
    transcript: `AI: Paul, let's review what we've covered so far. We've discussed superposition, wave-particle duality, and quantum entanglement. Which topic would you like to explore deeper?\nUser: I'd like to understand entanglement better. The idea that two particles can be connected across any distance seems impossible.\nAI: It does seem that way! Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance." Let me ask you this: what happens to one particle when you measure the other?\nUser: If you measure one and it's spin-up, the other immediately becomes spin-down, no matter how far apart they are.\nAI: Right! And this happens instantaneously. Does this violate the speed of light?\nUser: I read that it doesn't because you can't actually send information this way. Is that right?\nAI: Exactly. No usable information travels faster than light. The correlations are real, but they can't be used for faster-than-light communication.`,
  },
  {
    source: "demo-fixture",
    transcript: `AI: Today we're going to apply what you've learned. I'll give you some quantum mechanics problems and we'll work through them together.\nUser: Sounds good. I've been practicing the math.\nAI: Great! First question: A photon passes through a beam splitter that has a 50/50 chance of reflecting or transmitting. Describe the photon's state after the beam splitter.\nUser: It's in a superposition of being reflected and transmitted. So it's kind of in both paths at once.\nAI: Perfect. Now, if we put detectors on both paths, what happens?\nUser: The superposition collapses and we detect the photon on one path or the other, each with 50% probability.\nAI: Excellent work, Paul. Your understanding has really deepened over our sessions.`,
  },
  {
    source: "demo-fixture",
    transcript: `AI: Welcome to our session on the uncertainty principle, Paul.\nUser: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, right? You can't know both position and momentum precisely at the same time.\nAI: That's the one! But here's a subtle point: this isn't about the limits of our measuring equipment. It's a fundamental property of nature. Why do you think that is?\nUser: Because particles are described by wave functions? And a wave that's spread out in space has well-defined momentum but not position?\nAI: That's a remarkably insightful answer. You're connecting wave mechanics to the uncertainty principle. The more localized a wave packet is, the less certain its momentum becomes. You've really grown in your understanding of quantum mechanics.`,
