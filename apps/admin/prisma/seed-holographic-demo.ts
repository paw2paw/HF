 *
 *   1. Aldermoor College          (A — appears first in domain picker)
 *   2. Curiosity Circle           (C — community domain, appears second)
 *   3. Greenfield Academy         (G — appears third)
 *
 * Each domain populates all 8 Holographic sections:
 *   Identity, Curriculum, Behavior, Onboarding, Channels,
 *   Readiness, Structure, Prompt Preview
 *
 * Idempotent: tagged with "holo-demo" source markers, cleanup-first.
