      `AI: Hi ${name}! Today I'd like to talk about how memory works. Have you come across the multi-store model before?\nUser: I think so — isn't it about short-term and long-term memory?\nAI: That's a great start! The multi-store model was proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968. It suggests there are three separate stores. Can you think what the third one might be, besides STM and LTM?\nUser: Is it like... sensory memory?\nAI: Exactly right — the sensory register. It takes in information from our senses and holds it very briefly. What do you think happens to most of that information?\nUser: It probably just disappears if we don't pay attention to it?\nAI: Spot on. Only information we pay attention to moves into short-term memory. Now, Miller found that STM has a specific capacity — any idea what that might be?\nUser: Seven things? I remember hearing that.\nAI: Yes! Miller's magic number — 7 plus or minus 2 items. And without rehearsal, STM only lasts about 18-30 seconds. That's why revision techniques matter so much. What happens when we rehearse information enough?\nUser: It goes into long-term memory?\nAI: Exactly. Through elaborative rehearsal, information transfers to LTM, which has potentially unlimited capacity and duration. You're building a solid understanding here, ${name}.`,

    params: ["engagement", "comprehension", "recall"],
    transcript: (name: string) =>
      `AI: ${name}, last time we talked about the multi-store model. Today let's look at a more detailed model of short-term memory — the working memory model. Have you heard of Baddeley and Hitch?\nUser: Not really, no.\nAI: That's fine — they proposed this model in 1974. Instead of one simple STM store, they suggested we have a system with multiple components. The boss of the system is called the central executive. What do you think its job might be?\nUser: Controlling what we pay attention to?\nAI: Excellent thinking! The central executive directs attention and coordinates the other components. It's like a manager. One of those components is the phonological loop — it deals with auditory information. Ever noticed how you can 'hear' a song in your head?\nUser: Oh yeah, like when a song gets stuck!\nAI: Perfect example! That's your phonological loop at work. There's also the visuo-spatial sketchpad — can you guess what that handles?\nUser: Visual stuff? Like pictures in your mind?\nAI: Exactly — it processes visual and spatial information. Think of it as your mental whiteboard. The model also has an episodic buffer, added later by Baddeley, which integrates information from the other components with LTM. This model explains a lot that the multi-store model couldn't.`,

    transcript: (name: string) =>
      `AI: Hello ${name}! Today we're exploring the different types of long-term memory. Tulving proposed that LTM isn't just one store — it's actually three. Can you remember any of them?\nUser: Umm... is one of them about personal memories?\nAI: Yes! That's episodic memory — memories of personal events and experiences, like your last birthday. They're time-stamped and often have emotional associations. What about a type of memory that's more about facts and knowledge?\nUser: Semantic memory?\nAI: Brilliant! Semantic memory stores our general knowledge — facts, concepts, meanings. Like knowing that Paris is the capital of France. And there's a third type that's quite different from both of those.\nUser: I'm not sure about the third one.\nAI: It's procedural memory — memory for skills and actions. Things like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard. The interesting thing is that procedural memories are often unconscious. Can you think of something you do automatically without thinking about it?\nUser: Tying my shoelaces! I don't even think about it.\nAI: Perfect example. And here's what's really fascinating — brain damage can affect one type while leaving others intact, which supports Tulving's idea that they really are separate systems.`,

    params: ["engagement", "comprehension", "recall"],
    transcript: (name: string) =>
      `AI: ${name}, today we're looking at eyewitness testimony — specifically how reliable our memories of events really are. Have you heard of Elizabeth Loftus?\nUser: I think she did experiments about car crashes?\nAI: That's right! Loftus and Palmer in 1974 showed participants a video of a car accident and then asked them to estimate the speed. The key was the verb used in the question. When they used 'smashed', what do you think happened to the speed estimates?\nUser: People probably said the cars were going faster?\nAI: Exactly. 'Smashed' produced an average estimate of 40.5 mph, while 'contacted' only produced 31.8 mph. Same video, different word, different memory. What does this tell us about the reliability of eyewitness testimony?\nUser: That the way you ask questions can change what people remember?\nAI: Precisely — these are called leading questions, and they can actually alter the memory itself, not just the report. Loftus called this the misinformation effect. In a follow-up study, participants asked about the cars 'smashing' were more likely to falsely report seeing broken glass. What implications does this have for criminal investigations?\nUser: Police need to be really careful how they word questions to witnesses.\nAI: Absolutely. This research has had a huge impact on how interviews are conducted. The cognitive interview technique was developed specifically to reduce these biases. Great critical thinking, ${name}.`,

    transcript: (name: string) =>
      `AI: Hi ${name}! Today we're diving into social influence — starting with conformity. Have you ever gone along with a group even when you thought they were wrong?\nUser: Definitely, like when everyone picks a restaurant I don't really want to go to.\nAI: That's a relatable example! Solomon Asch studied this in 1951. He had participants judge which line matched a standard, but the other 'participants' were actually confederates who gave wrong answers. What do you think happened?\nUser: Did people go along with the wrong answer?\nAI: Many did! 75% conformed at least once. But there are different types of conformity. Compliance is when you publicly agree but privately disagree — like your restaurant example. Internalisation is when you genuinely change your beliefs. Can you think of the difference?\nUser: So compliance is just going along with it, but internalisation is actually believing it?\nAI: Exactly. There's also identification — where you conform because you identify with a group role. Now, Milgram took this further with obedience. His famous 1963 experiment had participants deliver what they believed were electric shocks to another person. 65% went all the way to 450 volts. Why do you think people obeyed?\nUser: Because someone in authority told them to?\nAI: That's the key — legitimate authority. Milgram described an 'agentic state' where people see themselves as agents carrying out someone else's wishes rather than being personally responsible. It's a powerful and slightly unsettling finding.`,

      `AI: ${name}, we've looked at how majorities influence individuals. But can a minority change the majority's mind? What do you think?\nUser: I guess so — like how civil rights movements started with small groups?\nAI: That's an excellent real-world connection. Moscovici investigated this experimentally in 1969. He had groups judge the colour of slides. When a minority consistently called blue slides 'green', about 8% of the majority agreed. The key word there is 'consistently'. Why do you think consistency matters?\nUser: Because if they keep changing their mind, no one would take them seriously?\nAI: Exactly. Moscovici identified consistency as one of the key factors, along with commitment and flexibility. A consistent minority makes people think 'maybe they have a point'. This is different from majority influence — it tends to cause private acceptance rather than just public compliance. Can you think of a historical example where a minority view became the majority?\nUser: The suffragettes? They were a minority who wanted women to vote.\nAI: Perfect example. They demonstrated consistency, commitment, and were willing to make sacrifices. Over time, this caused a snowball effect — more people reconsidered their views, and eventually the majority shifted. This process of social change follows a pattern: drawing attention, creating cognitive conflict, consistency over time, and the augmentation principle.`,

      `AI: Today we're looking at attachment, ${name}. Let's start with how infants and caregivers interact. Have you noticed how babies and parents often mirror each other's expressions?\nUser: Yeah, like when a mum smiles and the baby smiles back?\nAI: Exactly — that's called interactional synchrony. And when the interaction is two-way, with both partners responding to each other, that's reciprocity. These early interactions are thought to be crucial for forming attachment bonds. Bowlby had a major theory about this. He proposed that attachment is innate — we're born with a biological drive to form attachments. Why might this be adaptive from an evolutionary perspective?\nUser: To keep the baby safe? If they're attached to someone, that person will protect them.\nAI: Spot on — it increases survival chances. Bowlby also proposed monotropy, the idea that infants form one primary attachment that's qualitatively different from others. This creates an 'internal working model' — a template for future relationships. If a child has a secure attachment, what kind of internal working model might they develop?\nUser: That relationships are safe and people can be trusted?\nAI: Exactly. Now, Ainsworth tested these ideas with her Strange Situation study in 1970. She observed how infants reacted to separation from and reunion with their caregiver. She identified three types: secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-resistant. About 70% were securely attached. What do you think secure attachment looks like?\nUser: The baby is upset when the mum leaves but happy when she comes back?\nAI: That's right — they show some distress at separation but are easily comforted on reunion. Avoidant infants show little distress and may ignore the caregiver on return, while resistant infants are very distressed and resist comfort. Brilliant understanding, ${name}.`,

      `AI: ${name}, today we're tackling a big question — what makes behaviour 'abnormal'? How would you define it?\nUser: Isn't it just behaviour that's different from normal?\nAI: That's one approach — statistical infrequency. If behaviour is more than 2 standard deviations from the mean, it's statistically rare. But can you see a problem with that definition?\nUser: Well... being really clever would be statistically rare too, and that's not a problem.\nAI: Brilliant insight! Statistical infrequency doesn't distinguish between desirable and undesirable rarity. That's a major limitation. Another approach is 'failure to function adequately' — judging abnormality by whether someone can cope with everyday life. Rosenhan and Seligman suggested looking at personal distress, maladaptive behaviour, and unpredictability. Why might this be a better approach?\nUser: Because it focuses on whether the person is actually struggling?\nAI: Yes, it considers the individual's experience. But even this has issues — who decides what 'adequate' functioning looks like? Let's shift to a specific disorder. Phobias are characterised by three components: emotional, behavioural, and cognitive. An excessive fear response, avoidance of the feared stimulus, and irrational beliefs about the danger. Mowrer explained phobias through his two-process model — classical conditioning creates the fear, and operant conditioning maintains it through avoidance. Can you explain why avoidance maintains the phobia?\nUser: Because if you avoid the thing, you never learn it's not actually dangerous?\nAI: Precisely — avoidance is negatively reinforced because it reduces anxiety, so the person never has the chance to learn the stimulus isn't actually harmful. That's really clear thinking.`,
