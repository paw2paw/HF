User: Samuel Pepys says the fire started on Sunday 2nd September 1666 in the early hours. He was woken by his maid.
AI: Excellent retrieval! Now look at the map. Where did the fire begin?
User: The map shows it started in Pudding Lane, near the bakery of Thomas Farriner. I can see from the shaded area that it spread mostly to the west and north because the wind was blowing that direction — which matches what Pepys describes about the easterly wind.
AI: Brilliant — you've connected the map evidence with the diary. That's really strong cross-source analysis. Now, looking at the timeline chart, what pattern do you notice about the spread?
User: The chart shows the fire grew fastest on Monday and Tuesday. By Wednesday it was slowing down. I think that's because the King ordered houses to be pulled down to create firebreaks — Pepys mentions this too. So the sources all confirm each other.
AI: Outstanding work. You've retrieved specific details, cross-referenced across all three sources, and drawn a well-supported inference about the firebreaks. Let's try one more…`,

AI: Good — can you find the exact date?
User: September 2nd. Pepys was told about it by his maid.
AI: Well done. Now look at the map. Where did the fire start?
User: Pudding Lane. I can see the shaded bit showing where it burned.
AI: Can you tell from the map which direction it spread?
User: It looks like it went… to the left? Towards the river maybe? Oh wait, the key says west. Yes, it spread west.
AI: Good. Now can you connect that to anything in the diary?
User: Um, Pepys talks about wind. Maybe the wind pushed it west?

User: It feels mysterious and quite dramatic. Hughes describes the Iron Man standing on the cliff edge in the darkness. The phrase "taller than a house" is a comparison — I think it's actually hyperbole because it makes him seem impossibly big and powerful.
AI: Excellent identification of hyperbole! What about the phrase "his eyes were like headlamps"?
User: That's a simile comparing his eyes to headlamps. It creates a really vivid image — it makes him seem mechanical and a bit scary because headlamps cut through darkness. It also suggests he can see far, which makes him seem powerful.
AI: Wonderful analysis of the effect. Now, what do you think the word "luminous" means in the phrase "luminous eyes"?
User: Well "lumen" is to do with light, so luminous must mean glowing or shining. It fits with the headlamp simile — his eyes are giving off light in the darkness.
AI: Perfect use of word roots. Your inference skills are really strong, {{name}}.`,

AI: What technique is the author using there?
User: Is it a simile? Because it's comparing him to a house?
AI: It's actually a slightly different technique — it's exaggeration to make him seem impossibly large. We call that hyperbole. What about "his eyes were like headlamps"?
User: That's a simile because it uses "like."
AI: Correct! Why does Hughes compare his eyes to headlamps?
User: Because they're bright? And kind of round?

User: The lights on a car?
AI: Exactly. So what is the author telling us about the Iron Man's eyes?
User: They're bright?

User: Charlotte is an exceptionally loyal friend to Wilbur because she literally saves his life through her own creativity. We can see this when she writes "SOME PIG" in her web — this shows she's willing to use her own skills and energy to protect him. The fact that she works through the night weaving these words suggests that her friendship goes beyond words into real self-sacrifice. As a reader, I think this is especially powerful because Charlotte knows she will die soon, which makes her actions even more selfless.
AI: That's an outstanding PEA paragraph, {{name}}! You made a clear point about loyalty, provided a specific quotation as evidence, and your analysis explored the deeper meaning of self-sacrifice. You even added a personal interpretation with "as a reader." Excellent work.

AI: Good start! You've got a point and some evidence. Can you add more analysis — why does this show she cares?
User: Because she didn't have to do it? She chose to help him even though it was hard work.

User: Desolate means empty, bleak, and lifeless. I can tell because it says there are no green trees and the earth is parched and barren — all the describing words around it suggest something lifeless and deserted.
AI: Perfect use of context clues! What about "verdant"?
User: Verdant means green and lush — like full of plant life. I know this because the sentence contrasts it with "parched" and "barren," so verdant must be the opposite. Also, "verd" is like "verde" which means green in Spanish and French.
AI: Excellent — you've used both context and etymology! That's a really sophisticated vocabulary skill, {{name}}.`,

      high: `AI: We've just finished reading "The Tunnel" by Anthony Browne. Can you summarise the story in three or four sentences?
User: "The Tunnel" is about a brother and sister who are very different and don't get along. The brother discovers a tunnel and crawls through it into a mysterious forest. When he gets lost and turns to stone, his sister bravely follows and rescues him by hugging the stone figure. After that they become closer and learn to appreciate each other.
AI: That's an excellent summary — you've captured the beginning, middle, and end without including unnecessary detail. What do you think the main theme is?
User: I think the main theme is that love between siblings can overcome any differences. The tunnel is a metaphor for the journey from conflict to understanding. Rose has to face her fears to save her brother, which shows that real love requires bravery. I also think Browne is saying that people who seem very different can still deeply care about each other.

AI: Brilliant — you understand both the rule and the reason. Now, can you punctuate this speech: the teacher said put your books away children
User: "Put your books away, children," the teacher said. I need speech marks around what's said, a comma before "children" because it's direct address, and a comma before "the teacher said" because the speech continues into the reporting clause.

AI: That's excellent — you've created a multi-clause complex sentence. Can you identify the main clause?

  CREATIVE COMPREHENSION — PRACTICE WORKSHEET
  11+ Preparation: Inference, Retrieval & Analysis
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PASSAGE A — "The Secret Garden" (adapted from Frances Hodgson Burnett)

  When Mary first stepped through the hidden door, she could hardly
  believe her eyes. The garden had been locked for ten years, and
  nature had woven a wild tapestry across every wall and pathway.
  Climbing roses had scrambled over the grey stones like green
  curtains, and beneath them, tiny green points were pushing through
  the dark earth — determined little shoots that refused to give up.

  "It isn't quite dead," Mary whispered, dropping to her knees.
  Her heart hammered with a feeling she had never known before —
  something between excitement and fierce protectiveness, as though
  the garden had chosen her to bring it back to life.


PASSAGE B — Garden Restoration Data (non-fiction)

  | Year | Plants Identified | Species Recovered | Visitor Interest |
  |------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
  | 1911 |        12        |         3         |      Low        |
  | 1912 |        34        |        12         |    Growing      |
  | 1913 |        67        |        28         |      High       |

  The Royal Horticultural Society notes that abandoned gardens can
  recover within 2-3 growing seasons if root systems remain intact.
  "Roses are particularly resilient," explains Dr Sarah Chen.
  "Their root networks can survive decades of neglect."


QUESTIONS

  1. RETRIEVAL: According to Passage A, how long had the garden
     been locked? Find the exact detail in the text.  [1 mark]

  2. INFERENCE: What does the phrase "fierce protectiveness" tell
     us about how Mary feels towards the garden? What can we
     infer about her character from this reaction?   [2 marks]

  3. LITERARY DEVICES: Identify the simile in the first paragraph
     and explain its effect on the reader.           [2 marks]

  4. VOCABULARY: What does "tapestry" mean in context? How do the
     surrounding words help you work out the meaning? [2 marks]

  5. CROSS-SOURCE: Using both passages, explain why there is hope
     for the garden's recovery. Use evidence from both the fiction
     and non-fiction texts.                           [3 marks]

  6. PEA PRACTICE: Write a Point-Evidence-Analysis paragraph
     answering: "How does the author make the reader feel
     hopeful about the garden?"                      [3 marks]

  7. OPINION: Do you think Mary is the right person to look after
     the garden? Give your opinion with evidence.    [2 marks]
