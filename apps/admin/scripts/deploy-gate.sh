#!/usr/bin/env bash
# deploy-gate.sh — mandatory pre-deploy check. Runs fast local gates + VM-
# routed verification before /deploy is allowed to proceed. Designed to
# catch the failure modes that have actually bitten us in production:
#
#   1. Missing migration on target env (2026-04-15 incident: ContentSource.
#      extractorVersion missing, prod code expected it).
#   2. Broken production build (syntax or type errors in shipped code).
#   3. Dead routes — unit tests pass but a route is broken end-to-end.
#
# Design notes on why each gate is what it is:
#
#   Gate 1 uses `npm run build` (next build), NOT raw `tsc --noEmit`, because
#     Next.js build is what actually deploys. Raw tsc is stricter and surfaces
#     pre-existing type debt the build tolerates — those are valid bugs to
#     triage in Sprint 2, but blocking tonight's deploy on them punishes the
#     person shipping today's fixes for yesterday's tech debt.
#
#   Gate 4 runs on the VM via gcloud SSH, NOT from the developer's laptop,
#     because Cloud SQL private IPs are only reachable from inside the VPC.
#     A laptop-side prisma migrate status can't see the target DB at all.
#     The VM is already inside the VPC so the migration diff works there.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/deploy-gate.sh <env>
#     env: dev | test | prod
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all gates green, safe to deploy
#   1 — at least one gate failed (details printed)
#   2 — invocation error
