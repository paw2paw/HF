/**
 * Channel capability registry — what each delivery surface can deliver.
 *
 * Authoritative answer to: "can this channel render a PDF / image / link?"
 * Used by the materials-sharing gate in `app/api/chat/tools.ts` to suppress
 * the catalog when the live channel can't render rich media (e.g. voice
 * calls, plain SMS).
 *
 * Two layers gate sharing:
 *   1. Channel capability (this file) — technical: can the surface render it?
 *   2. Course intent (`PlaybookConfig.shareMaterials`) — pedagogical: does
 *      the educator want this course to share?
 *
 * Either layer can suppress. The full gate composes them with AND.
