/**
 * Teaching Style Transform
 *
 * Reads the playbook's interactionPattern (socratic | directive | advisory | coaching | ...)
 * and the resolved archetype to produce style-specific instructions for the voice prompt.
 *
 * This complements pedagogy-mode.ts:
 *   pedagogy-mode  → WHAT to teach (recall / comprehension / practice / syllabus)
 *   teaching-style  → HOW to interact (question-led / explanation-led / advisory / ...)
 *
 * Layer model:
 *   L1: ARCHETYPE (per-domain)  → [IDENTITY]
 *   L2: PERSONA TUNING (per-PB) → [STYLE]
 *   L2b: TEACHING STYLE (per-PB) → [INTERACTION APPROACH]  ← THIS
 *   L3: TEACHING MODE (per-PB)  → [PEDAGOGY MODE]
 *   L4: TEACH METHOD (per-TP)   → knowledge retrieval tags
