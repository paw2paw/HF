The **Simulator** runs the full pipeline — personality measurement, adaptation, prompt composition — without a real phone connection.\n\n## What you'll learn\n\n- **Start a test conversation** — chat with the tutor as a simulated caller\n- **Observe adaptation** — watch the tutor adjust to personality traits\n- **Understand the pipeline** — see what happens behind each message\n- **Readiness checklist** — know when the tutor is ready for real callers\n\n## Why this matters\n\nLaunching an untested tutor risks a bad first impression. The simulator lets you catch issues before they affect real learners.\n\n## Time: ~5 minutes\n\nUse **← →** arrow keys or the buttons below to navigate."
