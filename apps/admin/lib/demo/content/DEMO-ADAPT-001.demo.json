ADAPT (Adjust)\n\nThe system takes the measurements and adjusts target parameters:\n- If a caller is highly visual, increase diagram and example usage\n- If a caller is introverted, use a gentler, more patient tone\n- If comprehension is low, slow down pacing and add more repetition\n\n## 3. COMPOSE (Build)\n\nAdapted parameters are woven into the next prompt:\n- Personality-matched tone and language\n- Learning-style-appropriate teaching strategies\n- Content selected and ordered for this specific caller\n\n---\n\n**This cycle repeats every call**, getting more accurate over time as the system builds a richer profile."
