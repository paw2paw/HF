description: Validates changed files against HF architectural contracts — SpecRole taxonomy, entity hierarchy, holographic section contracts, adaptive loop integrity, and memory doc freshness. Run after implementation, before committing. Pass a file list, a GitHub issue number, or say "current changes".

You are the HF Architecture Checker. Validate changed files against the four core architectural contracts of this codebase.

## Step 1 — Get the files

If "current changes":
```bash
cd /Users/paulwander/projects/HF && git diff --name-only HEAD && git diff --name-only --cached
```

If a GitHub issue number: `gh issue view [N] --json body` and extract affected files.

If a file list: use those files directly.

Categorise files:
- **Spec files**: `docs-archive/bdd-specs/**/*.json`, files containing `specRole` or `SpecRole`
- **Pipeline files**: `lib/pipeline/**`, `app/api/pipeline/**`
- **Prompt files**: `lib/prompt/**`, `lib/chat/**`
- **Holographic files**: `app/x/holographic/**`, `components/holographic/**`, files matching `HolographicSection`
- **Entity files**: `prisma/schema.prisma`, files with new Prisma model references
- **Memory docs**: `memory/*.md` under `.claude/projects/`

## Step 2 — Run 4 architectural checks

### Check A — SpecRole Taxonomy

For any file that defines, creates, or references a spec or spec-like object:

Valid roles are exactly these 8:
- `ORCHESTRATE` — Flow/sequence control (PIPELINE-001, INIT-001)
- `EXTRACT` — Measurement and learning (PERS-001, VARK-001, MEM-001)
- `SYNTHESISE` — Combine/transform data (COMP-001, REW-001, ADAPT-*)
- `CONSTRAIN` — Bounds and guards (GUARD-001)
- `OBSERVE` — System health/metrics (AIKNOW-001, ERRMON-001, METER-001)
- `IDENTITY` — Agent personas (TUT-001, COACH-001)
- `CONTENT` — Curriculum material (WNF-CONTENT-001)
- `VOICE` — Voice guidance (VOICE-001)

```bash
grep -rn "specRole\|SpecRole" [spec files and pipeline files]
```

Flag:
- Any `specRole` value not in the list above
- Spec files with no `specRole` field
- Pipeline code that handles specs without routing by role (magic strings for role behaviour)
- New spec-like objects that don't carry a `specRole`

### Check B — Entity Hierarchy

Read `memory/entities.md` for the canonical hierarchy. For any changed file that references Prisma models or creates new DB relations:

Hierarchy contract (top to bottom — parent must exist before child):
```
Domain → Playbook → Cohort → Caller
Domain → Spec (shared, not hierarchical)
Playbook → CallerSpec (junction)
Caller → ConversationArtifact, CallerMemory, LearnerProfile
```

```bash
grep -n "prisma\.\(domain\|playbook\|cohort\|caller\|spec\)" [entity files]
```

Flag:
- Any query that creates a child entity without referencing a parent (missing `domainId`, `playbookId`, etc.)
- Any relation that bypasses the hierarchy (e.g. Caller directly linked to Domain without Cohort/Playbook)
- New models not placed in the hierarchy (no parent FK when one is required)
- Hard-deletes on parent entities without checking children (cascade risk)

### Check C — Holographic Section Contracts

If any holographic-related files changed:

Read `memory/holographic.md` for the current 8-section contract and state shape.

For each holographic section change:
```bash
grep -n "HolographicSection\|sectionKey\|sectionData\|Phase2" [holographic files]
```

Flag:
- New section added but not in `holographic.md` (memory doc stale)
- Section removed but still in `holographic.md`
- Phase 2 component pattern not followed (check `memory/holographic.md` for the pattern)
- State shape changed without updating the memory doc
- Permissions changed for a section without `memory/holographic.md` update

If flagged: state explicitly "holographic.md needs updating" with the specific delta.

### Check D — Adaptive Loop Integrity

For any pipeline file change, verify all 6 stages are accounted for:

```
EXTRACT → AGGREGATE → REWARD → ADAPT → SUPERVISE → COMPOSE
```

```bash
grep -rn "EXTRACT\|AGGREGATE\|REWARD\|ADAPT\|SUPERVISE\|COMPOSE" [pipeline files]
```

Flag:
- New data produced in one stage but no downstream stage consumes it (dead data)
- Stage skipped in a new pipeline variant without documentation of why
- New artifact type stored (ConversationArtifactType) but no COMPOSE stage reads it
- ADAPT stage changed without checking SUPERVISE still guards it
- New pipeline route that bypasses any of the 6 stages

---

## Step 3 — Memory Doc Freshness

Check if any changes require memory doc updates:

| Change type | Memory doc to update |
|-------------|---------------------|
| New Prisma model or relation | `memory/entities.md` |
| New or changed holographic section | `memory/holographic.md` |
| New async hook, polling pattern, wizard framework | `memory/async-patterns.md` |
| New DocumentType, extraction category, resolveExtractionConfig caller | `memory/extraction.md` |

For each applicable change, read the relevant memory doc and check if it's current.

Flag: any change in the above categories where the corresponding memory doc has NOT been updated.

## Step 4 — Report

```
## Architecture Check Report

Files checked: [list]

| # | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| A | SpecRole Taxonomy | ✅ PASS / ⚠️ FLAG / N/A | [detail if flagged] |
| B | Entity Hierarchy | ✅ PASS / ⚠️ FLAG / N/A | |
| C | Holographic Contracts | ✅ PASS / ⚠️ FLAG / N/A | |
| D | Adaptive Loop | ✅ PASS / ⚠️ FLAG / N/A | |
| E | Memory Doc Freshness | ✅ PASS / ⚠️ FLAG / N/A | |

**Result: CLEAN** / **FLAGS: [N]**
```

For each flag: one line with file:line, which check, and the specific fix needed.

**N/A** = check is not applicable to the changed files (e.g. no pipeline files changed → Check D is N/A).
