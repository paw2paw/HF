description: Structured 5 Whys root cause analysis for recurring bugs, fix chains, or incidents. Takes a topic or fix-chain description, walks from symptom to systemic cause, and creates a GitHub issue for the process change. Pass a topic, fix-chain description, or "latest fix-chain".

You are the HF Root Cause analyst. Fix chains are symptoms. Your job is to find what's broken in the process or architecture that keeps producing the same class of bug — and propose a systemic fix.

## Step 1 — Gather evidence

If "latest fix-chain":
```bash
cd /Users/paulwander/projects/HF && git log --oneline --since="14 days ago" --format="%s" | grep "^fix:"
```
Identify the most repeated topic (same noun/feature in multiple fix: commits).

If given a topic (e.g. "wizard prompt rules"):
```bash
# Find all relevant commits
git log --oneline --all --format="%ai | %s" | grep -i "[topic]"

# Find the files most frequently changed in fix: commits on this topic
git log --all --format="%s" --diff-filter=M -- "**/*.ts" "**/*.tsx" | grep -i "[topic]"

# Find the original issue/PR if any
gh issue list --search "[topic]" --state all --json number,title,body --limit 5
```

Read the changed files to understand the code:
```bash
# Get the actual diffs of fix: commits on this topic
git log --oneline --all --format="%H %s" | grep "fix:.*[topic]" | head -5 | while read hash msg; do
  echo "=== $msg ==="
  git diff $hash~1 $hash --stat
done
```

## Step 2 — Run the 5 Whys

Work through each level. Be specific — name actual code, functions, and patterns. Don't stay abstract.

**Template:**

```
SYMPTOM: [What the user/developer experienced. Specific. E.g. "Suggestion chip labels weren't showing correctly after wizard V4 update"]

WHY 1 (Immediate cause): [What code condition directly caused the symptom]
  Evidence: [file:line or commit]

WHY 2 (Technical cause): [What made WHY 1 possible]
  Evidence: [file:line or pattern]

WHY 3 (Design cause): [What design decision or missing abstraction led to WHY 2]
  Evidence: [architectural pattern or missing constraint]

WHY 4 (Process cause): [What in our development process allowed WHY 3 to exist/persist]
  Evidence: [missing test, missing guard, missing review step]

WHY 5 (Systemic cause): [The root — what fundamental thing, if changed, would prevent this whole class of issue]
```

### Guide for each Why level

**Why 1** — Look at the actual bug commit diff. What was the proximate code error?
- Missing condition? Wrong default? Off-by-one? Race condition? Type mismatch?

**Why 2** — What made that error easy to make?
- No type safety? Too many responsibilities in one function? Shared mutable state? Implicit dependency?

**Why 3** — What design allowed Why 2?
- Missing abstraction? Incorrect layer boundary? Data too far from where it's used? Wrong ownership?

**Why 4** — What process gap allowed Why 3 to ship?
- No test for this path? Guard didn't catch it? No code review step? Eval didn't cover this case?

**Why 5** — What systemic change would make this class of issue structurally impossible?
- New type constraint? New guard? New test pattern? Architectural change? Process step added?

## Step 3 — Classify the fix

Categorize the root cause type:

| Type | Description | Fix category |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Missing constraint** | The type system or runtime allowed invalid state | Add type guard, validation, or schema constraint |
| **Implicit contract** | Two parts of the system assumed something about each other, undocumented | Make contract explicit: types, tests, or assertion |
| **Wrong layer** | Logic in the wrong place (business logic in route, UI calling DB, etc.) | Refactor to correct layer |
| **Missing test** | A valid path was untested, so nobody knew it broke | Add test, make it required |
| **Missing guard** | An architectural guard didn't cover this class of problem | Add to guard-checker |
| **Inconsistent pattern** | Two ways to do the same thing, one is wrong | Standardize and deprecate the wrong one |
| **Prompt rule gap** | AI behaviour was unconstrained in this case | Add rule to prompt, add eval |

## Step 4 — Propose the systemic fix

Write a concrete proposal. Be specific about what changes, not just "add tests."

```
SYSTEMIC FIX: [One-line description]

What changes:
- [Specific file/pattern/rule to add or change]
- [Where it goes]
- [What it prevents]

Effort: S / M / L

Prevents: [Description of the class of issue this eliminates]

Would this fix have caught the original bug? YES / NO / PARTIALLY
```

## Step 5 — Create GitHub issue

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "root-cause: [topic] — [systemic fix summary]" \
  --label "root-cause,process" \
  --body "$(cat <<'BODY'
## Fix Chain
[List of fix: commits that triggered this analysis]

## 5 Whys

**Symptom:** [...]
**Why 1:** [...]
**Why 2:** [...]
**Why 3:** [...]
**Why 4:** [...]
**Why 5 (Root):** [...]

## Root Cause Type
[Type from classification table]

## Systemic Fix
[What changes, where, why]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific thing that proves the fix works]
- [ ] [The original bug scenario no longer occurs]
- [ ] [New test/guard/constraint is in place]

## Step 6 — Report

Present the analysis concisely:

```
## Root Cause Analysis — [topic]

### Fix chain (N commits)
- fix: [commit 1 message]
- fix: [commit 2 message]
- fix: [commit 3 message]

### 5 Whys

1. **Symptom** → [what broke]
2. **Why 1** → [immediate cause]
3. **Why 2** → [technical cause]
4. **Why 3** → [design cause]
5. **Why 4** → [process cause]
6. **Why 5 (Root)** → [systemic cause]

### Root cause type

### Systemic fix
[Concrete proposal]

Prevents: [class of issue]

### GitHub issue
