description: Validates a Prisma schema change before running migrate dev — checks for destructive operations, data migration needs, seed script impacts, and states whether /vm-cp or /vm-cpp is needed. Pass "current changes", a migration file path, or "schema".

You are the HF Migration Checker. One bad migration in prod is catastrophic. Check before running.

## Step 1 — Get the schema diff

If "current changes" or "schema" or no argument:
```bash
cd /Users/paulwander/projects/HF && git diff HEAD -- apps/admin/prisma/schema.prisma
```

If a migration file path: read that file directly.

Also read the current schema for context:
```bash
# Read apps/admin/prisma/schema.prisma
```

And check for any pending migration files:
```bash
ls -lt apps/admin/prisma/migrations/ | head -5
```

## Step 2 — Check for destructive operations

Scan the schema diff for each risk pattern:

### 🔴 DESTRUCTIVE — data loss risk

| Pattern | What to look for | Risk |
|---------|-----------------|------|
| **Column drop** | Field present in `-` lines, absent in `+` lines | All data in that column is deleted |
| **Required field added** | `+  fieldName  Type` without `?` and without `@default(...)` | Existing rows will fail — need backfill first |
| **Type change** | `-  fieldName  String` → `+  fieldName  Int` | Type coercion may fail on existing data |
| **Enum value removed** | Value in `-@map` or removed from enum block | Rows with that value become invalid |
| **Table drop** | Model removed entirely from schema | All data in that table is deleted |
| **Unique constraint added** | `@@unique` or `@unique` added to column | Will fail if existing data has duplicates |
| **Index drop** | `@@index` removed | Query performance regression |
| **Relation required** | `relationField  Type` without `?` added | Existing rows with no relation will fail |

### 🟡 NEEDS DATA MIGRATION

| Pattern | When needed |
|---------|------------|
| New non-null column | Need to backfill with real values before making required |
| Column rename | Need to copy data from old name to new name |
| Enum value renamed | Need to update existing rows |
| FK added to existing table | Need to ensure all rows have valid FK values |

### 🟢 SAFE (no data risk)

- New optional field (`fieldName Type?`)
- New field with `@default(value)`
- New model (no existing data)
- New index added
- New enum value added (existing values still valid)
- Field made optional (`Type` → `Type?`)
- Comment changes

## Step 3 — Check seed scripts

Look at what changed and check if seed scripts need updating:
```bash
# Check seed files
ls apps/admin/prisma/seed/
```

Read relevant seed files for the changed models. Ask:
- Does the new field need a value in seed data?
- Does a removed field need to be removed from seed inserts?
- Does a new enum value need to be seeded?
- Does a renamed field break existing seed references?

Search for the model name in seed files:
```bash
grep -rn "[ModelName]" apps/admin/prisma/seed/ apps/admin/prisma/
```

## Step 4 — Check for enum usage

If any enum was changed:
```bash
grep -rn "[EnumName]" apps/admin/lib/ apps/admin/app/api/ | grep -v ".test.ts" | head -20
```

List every usage site that may need updating.

## Step 5 — Deploy command

Based on findings, state clearly which deploy command is needed:

- **No schema changes** → `/vm-cp`
- **Safe schema changes only** (new optional fields, new models, new indexes) → `/vm-cpp`
- **Destructive changes** → `/vm-cpp` + data migration script required first
- **Enum changes with usage sites** → `/vm-cpp` + update all usage sites first

## Step 6 — Report

```
## Migration Check — [description of change]

### Schema changes detected

| Field/Model | Change | Risk |
|-------------|--------|------|
| `User.phoneNumber` | New required field, no default | 🔴 DESTRUCTIVE |
| `CallStatus` enum | Added `PENDING` value | 🟢 SAFE |
| `Transcript.rawText` | Made optional (String → String?) | 🟢 SAFE |
| `LegacyLog` model | Removed entirely | 🔴 DESTRUCTIVE |

---

### 🔴 Issues requiring action before migrate

**1. `User.phoneNumber` — required field without default**
  → All existing User rows will fail migration.
  → Fix: Either add `@default("")` or add `?` to make optional, then backfill.
  → OR: Write a data migration script to populate from existing data.

**2. `LegacyLog` model removed**
  → All data in `LegacyLog` table will be permanently deleted.
  → Confirm: is this data safe to discard? Check row count first:
    `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "LegacyLog";`

---

### Seed script impact

- `apps/admin/prisma/seed/users.ts` — must add `phoneNumber` field (or remove if field is made optional)
- No other seed files affected.

---

### Enum usage sites (if applicable)

None.

---

### Verdict

❌ NOT SAFE TO MIGRATE — 2 destructive changes require action first.

Fix required:
1. Add `@default("")` to `phoneNumber` or make it optional
2. Confirm `LegacyLog` data is safe to drop, then proceed
3. Update seed/users.ts

Deploy command when ready: `/vm-cpp`
```

## Migration Check

### Schema changes detected

| Field/Model | Change | Risk |
|-------------|--------|------|
| `Course.physicalMaterials` | New optional field `String?` | 🟢 SAFE |
| `Course.preamble` | New optional field `String?` | 🟢 SAFE |

---

### Seed script impact

- No seed scripts reference `Course` model directly — no update needed.

---

### Verdict

✅ SAFE TO MIGRATE — all changes are additive and optional.

Deploy command: `/vm-cpp`
```
