Pull Request Checklist (BDD-Aligned)

Behaviour First
	•	This change is driven by a BDD feature or scenario
	•	The feature clearly describes user/system behaviour
	•	I did not implement logic without behaviour coverage

⸻

BDD Status
	•	All relevant BDD features pass locally
	•	New behaviour includes at least one new or updated scenario
	•	No existing behaviour was removed without updating features

⸻

Service Design
	•	Core logic lives in pure services (input → output)
	•	Services do not depend on databases, HTTP, or frameworks
	•	Any side effects are isolated outside core services

⸻

Infrastructure Discipline
	•	BDD tests do not require Docker or Postgres
	•	Infra changes are optional and isolated
	•	.runtime/ is untouched or ignored by git

⸻

	•	Call
	•	Transcript
	•	Analysis
	•	Memory
	•	Next Prompt

No step is skipped or bypassed.

⸻

Safety & Maintainability
